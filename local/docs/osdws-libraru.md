# OSDWorkspace Library
The OSDWorkspace Library is where you store all the content that is used by OSDWorkspace to create BootMedia. The Library is organized into folders that contain the content used by OSDWorkspace. The Library is created when the `OSD.Workspace PowerShell Module` is first used and is located at `C:\OSDWorkspace\Library`.

Additionally, the OSDWorkspace Library is initialized as a Git Submodule when the `OSD.Workspace PowerShell Module` is first used. This allows you to track changes to the Library content using Git.
